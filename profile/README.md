# Autonomous Avalanche Rescue üèî‚õë

Avalanches kill over 150 people worldwide every year.[^1] After getting caught in an avalanche, your chances of survival in the first 15 minutes are around 90%. After 30 minutes, your chances drop to 30%. Rescue teams must get to avalanche victims in the fastest time possible.

Our goal is to create an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) that can search for and detect signals emitted from avalanche transceivers and mark the victim's locations autonomously to reduce search time of avalanche victims.

To learn more about avalanches in general, visit the [National Avalanche Center](https://avalanche.org/#/current)'s website.

## About the project
 This year, the Avidrone project saw developments in: 

 - Expanding search capabilities by implementing an algorithm for primary search.
 
 - Developing a simluation for automated mission testing using [Ardupilot](https://ardupilot.org/) and [MAVproxy](https://ardupilot.org/mavproxy/index.html).

 - Implementing CLI arguments and creating a custom build of [QGroundControl](http://qgroundcontrol.com/) (QGC)

 - Developing specialized hardware components.

This project continued looking into the feasibility of using a drone as a helpful tool for avalanche search victims, potentially in a way that is quicker and safer than traditional methods.
