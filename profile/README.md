# Autonomous Avalanche Rescue üèî‚õë


Avalanches kill over 150 people worldwide every year.[^1] After getting caught in an avalanche, your chances of survival in the first 15 minutes are around 90%. After 30 minutes, your chances drop to 30%. Rescue teams must get to avalanche victims in the fastest time possible.
[^1]: [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/avalanche/)

**The end goal of this project is to**

- Create an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) that can search for and detect signals emitted from avalanche transceivers
-  Mark the victim's locations autonomously
-  Reduce search time for avalanche victims.
