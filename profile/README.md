# Autonomous Avalanche Rescue 🏔

Avalanches kill over 150 people worldwide every year. After getting caught in an avalanche, your chances of survival in the first 15 minutes are around 90%. After 30 minutes, your chances drop to 30%. Rescue teams must get to avalanche victims in the fastest time possible.

Our goal is to create an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) that can search for and detect signals emitted from avalanche transceivers and mark the victim's locations autonomously.

## About the project
The AviDrone is an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) that should be capable of: 

- Searching for and detecting signals emitted from avalanche transceivers 
- Marking the buried victims’ locations 

This project is a continuation of a previous team of four. This year, the drone is intended to be expanded in three key ways: 

- Improvements made to the hardware to reduce EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) and add a height sensor to the device 
- Expansions to the autonomous search capabilities of the drone in the form of a primary search phase that transitions into a secondary search phase 
- Integration with a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to provide a convenient user experience when operating the drone 

This iteration of the AviDrone project saw developments in: 

- Primary search implementation 
- Secondary search improvements 
- Secondary search simulation improvements 
- Drone EMI testing 
- Drone height sensor implementation 
- Basic GUI setup 

This project continued looking into the feasibility of using a drone as a helpful tool for avalanche search victims, potentially in a way that is quicker and safer than traditional methods.
